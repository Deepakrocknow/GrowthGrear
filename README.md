# Gen AI Analytics Backend

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   - Open your terminal and run:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

2. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**:

   - Change into the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd mern-gen-ai-analytics/backend
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   - Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Start the Server**:
   - To start the server, run:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - This will start the server using `nodemon`, which automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected.

## API Endpoints and `curl` Commands

- **Response**: `{ "data": "Mock response for query: Your query here" }`

**Example `curl` Command**:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/query -H "Authorization: Bearer mock-token" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "What is the sales data for Q1?"}'
POST /api/explain
Description: Returns a simulated query breakdown.
Headers: Authorization: Bearer mock-token, Content-Type: application/json
Body: { "query": "Your query here" }
Response: { "explanation": "Pseudo-SQL for query: Your query here" }
Example curl Command:

Testing Locally
Ensure your server is running on http://localhost:5000 before executing the curl commands.
You can test the endpoints using the provided curl commands in your terminal or use a tool like Postman for a more interactive experience.
Notes
Make sure to replace "Your query here" with the actual query you want to test.
The server should be running locally on port 5000, as specified in the server.js file.
If your application requires any environment variables, make sure to set them up in a .env file or directly in your environment.
